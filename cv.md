### About me
A user interface designer who decided to learn to code in Javascript to understand how interfaces work in real life. To make decisions based on the functionality of technology. My mission is to help people achieve their personal goals, to make users' lives more pleasant and comfortable. 

I have no experience as a developer, but I have experience as a designer both in a studio and freelance, and now I work in a service for creating online schools.
